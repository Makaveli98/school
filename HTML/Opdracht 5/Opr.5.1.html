    <h3>5 Differences between the Manga and Anime</h3>
    1.The anime has considerably less blood than its manga counterpart.<br>
    2.One of the most obvious differences between the manga and anime is<br>
    that the manga doesn't have any filler story arcs, while the anime has<br>
    plenty. 3.After the war arc towards the end of Naruto: Shippuden, a<br>
    funeral was held for everyone who died during the war. Whereas in the manga,<br>
    the funeral was specifically held for Neji. Most fans appreciated that<br>
    the funeral was expanded to better pay respects to all characters who<br>
    perished on or off-screen during the epic final war arc.<br>
    4.One other major difference between the anime and manga was the<br>
    copious use of flashbacks.In some episodes of the show, you would<br>
    only get around ten minutes of new content. 5.The final fight between<br>
    Sasuke and Naruto in Shippuden is often one of the most well-remembered<br>
    of the entire series. That said, the anime did make some changes from the manga.<br>
    For instance, in the anime, Naruto had several visions of Sasuke from the past<br>
    that weren't shown in the manga.
